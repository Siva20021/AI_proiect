This project aims to create a machine learning model that can identify individuals with heart disease accurately using different medical factors.
By using advanced algorithms and statistical methods, the model is  capable of analyzing these factors and making precise predictions about the probability of an
individual having heart disease.
To develop the model, a large dataset of patient information was used, which includes information like demographics, medical history, and clinical test results.
